# Embedding JupyterLab

A browser based JupyterLab enviroment can be embedded within VLE URL activity/resource pages, or bundled into an `HTML5.zip` activity that can be rendered in an `HTML5` activity page, or embedded in a "website" page (e.g. as rendered from OU-XML).

The JupytherLab environment can be launched with a pre-opened notebook by setting a `lab/index.html?path=NOTEBOOK.ipynb` path.
