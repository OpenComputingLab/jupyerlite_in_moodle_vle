# Deployment Notes

JupyterLite environments can be deployed via the VLE in two main ways:

- link to a URL of the JupyterLite site running on a public URL;
- upload the modded JupyterLite site as an `HTML5.zip` activity bundle;

## BUNDLING FOR OU VLE

Currently, we need some hacks to the jupyerlite distribtuion when bundling it for OU VLE / HTML5.zip:

- filenames only allow [a-zA-Z-_]; so e.g. spaces in e.g. notebook filenames throw an error;
- the `index.html` pages in `lab/`, `tree/` and `notebooks/` need updating: `<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" /> ` needs to be set to `<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />` to handle the auth;
- the html5zip is referenced in an iframe with a load of URL paramters added to it by the vle'; this prevents the automatic redirect to eg `lab/index.html`; solution (h/t Claude.ai) is to strip the URL of unwanted params (note that this currently breaks the history/back button for the corresponding browser tab):

```javascript
function stripUriParameters() {
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);
  const path = url.searchParams.get('path');
  url.search = '';
  // The path parameter at least is valid
  if (path) {
    url.searchParams.set('path', path);
  }
  window.history.replaceState({}, '', url);
}

// Then in first line of function main():
//  stripUriParameters();
```

- to create the zip, we need an `index.html` at the root of the zip folder;  where a jupyterlite distribution asset is created by a GitHub action, unzip and untar the Jupyerlite asset uploaded by the action, `cd` into it and then (after any mods e.g. to `index.html` files), zip  the directory as root into a `.zip` archive file, e.g. `zip -r ../jupyterlite-dist-tm112.zip .`. If zipping a git tracked dir, add `--exclude "*.git*"` to the zip command to ignore git files.
- to get the html5 bundle URL, view the associated page; right click on the iframe and view it in a separate window to get the URL, or in browser dev tools, inspect page in to find the associated iframe and its `src` value.

## Example JupyterLite Xeus Python distribution


Example `build_environment.yml`:

```yaml
name: xeus-kernels
channels:
  - https://repo.mamba.pm/emscripten-forge
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python
  - pip
  - jupyter_server
  - jupyterlite-core >=0.3.0,<0.4.0
  - pip:
    - jupyterlite-xeus>=0.2.0a0,<0.3
```

Example `environment.yml`:

```yaml
name: xeus-python-kernel
channels:
  - https://repo.mamba.pm/emscripten-forge
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - pip
  - xeus-python
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - ipywidgets
  - requests
  - folium
  - pip:
    - ipython-magic-folium
```

We can also add a separate `requirements.txt` eg for extensions to the JupyterLite environment.

```text
# Core modules (mandatory)
jupyterlite-core
jupyterlab
notebook

jupyterlite-xeus

# Python kernel (optional)
#jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel

# JavaScript kernel (optional)
#jupyterlite-javascript-kernel==0.2.3

# Language support (optional)
jupyterlab-language-pack-fr-FR
jupyterlab-language-pack-zh-CN

# Jupyer environment extensions
jupyterlab-filesystem-access

jupyterlab-empinken-extension
jupyterlab-cell-status-extension
jupyterlab-ou-brand-extension

```

*TO DO / TO CHECK â€” what actually gets bundled and what gets added into the kernel as a preinstalled package? Are all packages listed in `environment.yaml` and `requirements.txt` bundled in the distribution? [From a quick look, it looks like they are all in the distribution; and perhaps the packages in the environment.yaml are installed into the kernel?]*

Example action for bundling a xeus Pyhton jupyterlite distribution:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install mamba
        uses: mamba-org/setup-micromamba@v1
        with:
          micromamba-version: '1.5.8-0'
          environment-file: build_environment.yml
          cache-environment: true
    
      - name: Install the dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Build the JupyterLite site
        run: |
          cp README*.md content
          jupyter lite build --contents content --output-dir dist

    # We can use the uploaded artifact 
    # as the basis for an HTML5.zip upload
    # BUT see elsewhere for required hacks

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: jupyterlite_dist
          path: ./dist

```

## BORKEDNESS

Issues in notebooks:

- JupyterLite now seems to drop explicit reference to `index.html` from the notebook homepage toc links; which breaks the VLE handler and means we can't open notebooks from the notebook index / ToC homepage.

Issues in JupyterLab:
