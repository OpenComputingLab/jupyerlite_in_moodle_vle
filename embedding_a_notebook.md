# Embedding a Single Notebook

Individual notebooks can be embedded within VLE URL activity/resource pages, or bundled into an `HTML5.zip` activity that can be rendered in an `HTML5` activity page, or embedded in a "website" page (e.g. as rendered from OU-XML).

Notebooks can be individually referenced via the `notebooks/index.html?path=NOTEBOOK.ipynb` path, allowing a particular notebook to be situated within the flow of a set of a week's activities, or embedded directly within a "website" web page:

*Currently, links from the notebook homepage/directory listing do not resolve correctly, so only single notebook access is supported in the notebook view at this time.*
