# Embedding Standalone Jupyter Environments in the OU Moodle VLE

Jupyter notebooks are used in a growing number of Open Univeristy (OU) modules to provide an interactive environment for delivering richly formatted teaching and learning materials that also support the execution of provided or student-generated computer code.

This document describes how Jupyter notebooks can be delivered to students within the context of the OU VLE and without the need for an external server using `JupyterLite`.

Individual notebooks as well as the more general JupyterLab environment can be embedded via *URL* and HTML5 asset/resource types.
